This file is about Docker's useful commands
More like a cheat sheet actually.
	docker images: Shows all images
	docker ps -a: Shows all containers

	docker pull <name>:<tag> : Pulls an image
	docker commit <name>: Commits a container to an image
	docker push <name>: Pushes an image
	docker build <pathOrUrl> : builds an image from that dockerfile 

	docker run -it <nameOrId> bash: Runs a container from image in that same terminal and gets you in that container's terminal.
	docker exec -it <id> bash: with this command you can enter a working container from another tab.

	docker (un)pause <id>: (un)pauses that container 
	docker start <id> : starts that container
	docker stop <id>: stops that container

	docker rm <id> : removes container
	docker rm -f <same> : force remove
	docker rmi <idOrName> : remove image

	docker inspect <id>: Inspects that container	

	there's also rename, tag, --name flag, --host flag and so on...
