This is a text file of an overview of ROS concepts and keywords.

ROS Concepts

	Nodes: The main 'workers' of a ros-based robot. They do all the job, they are like functions in a programming language. They also communicate constantly.
	Messages: While 2 assigned nodes are communicating, they deliver and receive messages. The communication is all built upon this message swaps.
	Topics: 2 (or more) nodes communicate, we know that. But they need to communicate through a channel which is named as topic(s).
	Services: Like nodes, they work for a specific purpose. The difference is, a service is mostly used only once (or when required) but nodes are often working non-stop.
	Packages: Like a directory, this structures maintain the related codes, information files and package dependencies in one place.
		Descriptives:
			message types: A Message's description.
			service types: A service's description.
			package manifests: A package's name,licenses, authors, its dependencies..etc is declared in this manifest.
	
	Rosmaster: The master that administrates nodes and collects/saves their data.
