You should start with typing:
	$roscore
		though it is not a requirement, this way is the healthiest.

In other tabs of the terminal, you can run nodes by:
	$rosrun <nodeName>

When setting up ros in a docker container;
start it by:
	$sudo docker run --name=cartcurt --net=host -it ros:melodic
		then when you're inside of that container, I always type:
			#source opt ..<someFiles>../setup.bash
			#sudo apt-get update
		if you want to download an existing ros package in a container, rather than creating that package by yourself, just type:
			#sudo apt-get install <packageName>
	
		for any other tab of the terminal connecting to that same container, don't forget to:
			#source opt ..<someDirectories>../setup.bash
		and then you can:	
			#rosrun <nodeName>
